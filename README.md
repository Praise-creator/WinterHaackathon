Refer to frontend-backend-merge branch
Current Idea: Help students manage assignments and prevent procrastination. Upload syllabus and assignments are auto linked to calendar. 
Assignments get broken down into chunks over multiple days to prevent leaving assignemnts to last minute. 

Features:
Document upload and proper information parsing (can identify due dates, and assignments/exams/projects and could potentially maake judgement based on grade weight although thats probaably for task splitting logic) 
frontend (upload buttons, sign in/log in page (can be removed if we dont get as far as user profiles) edit tasks , time requirements ...)
database setup (mongoDB as a suggestion)
google calendar sync (API Stuff)
task splitting logic (hard code ?)
